1. Make a *class*, called `Circle`, which describes a circle using its radius and colour. 
   Use your Colour class from the earlier of exercises to express the colour. 
2. In `main` are the shells of two methods - `area` and `circumference`. Complete the two methods so they return the values they should.
3. Create `area` and `circumference` as methods *within* your `Circle` class.
